To compile Qbox:

1. Go to trunk/src

2. Create an architecture include file, e.g. bgq_ctf_essl.mk.  This file should
define the make variables for compiling and linking (CXX, CXXFLAGS, LDFLAGS
etc.) and should contain the locations of all libraries and include files.

3.  Qbox requires ScaLAPACK 2 and dependent libraries (blas and lapack
or vendor-equivalents, e.g. ESSL), FFTW 2.x or equivalent, and
(optionally) Xerces XML. You also need the makedepend utility (in
Debian comes in the xutils-dev package).

4.  Build the code using the ARCH variable to point to this include file, e.g. 

make ARCH=bgq_ctf_essl

If the ARCH variable is not specified, a default value will be guessed
from the hostname or uname commands listed in Makefile.arch.  

5.  Object files are stored in objs-$(ARCH) subdirectories, so one can
compile multiple versions of the code simultaneously in the same
directory.
